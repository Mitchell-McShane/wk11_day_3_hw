1. Purpose of a breakpoint is: When debugging it will reach a line and when it reaches said line it will pause the application and run the debugger console.

2. No it stops running as its not being called and the breakpoint is highlighted by a blue window that shows what line the debugger is at.

3. Using the 'Step Over' command option. It will run the line of code then jump down to the next line and wait.

4. The step into command will switch into the Java method and will pause into that method.

5. Evaluate expression can evaluate and run some Java codes, call some methods on instances and objects that are created. While Code Fragment can run multiple lines of code and can create variables.
